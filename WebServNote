                        HTTP

.   The primary function of a web server is to store, process, and deliver web pages to
        clients. The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext
        Transfer Protocol (HTTP).


HTTP :
    is built on top of TCP (transmission control Protocl)

HTTP : communication protocol used by WEB APIS (Application Programming Interface)
    the protocol follows a client server model, where clients communicate with servers by
    sending requests and waiting for responses.
    one of the most important properties of http requests is the request method
    called the http verbs

            //+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\
                        GET (GET)
        request Method = Get
    . simple requests for infromation
    . should only retrieve(get back) data 
    . shouldn't result in modification of data

                Get employee information ----->(Get)-----> Employees API

            //+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\
                        POST (CREATE)
    . Modify the underlying data (modify the state of the underlying data)
    . create new resources (meaning whenever a new employee is hired by out company
        we woulf send a post request to the employee's endpoint to add a new employee
        resource)

            //+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\
                        DELETE
    . Remove existing resources (whenever an employee leaves our company we might send
        a delete request to the employee api to remove the employee from our systems )

                            RFC

    RFC documents contain technical specifications and organizational notes for the Internet.


IETF : (The Internet Engineering Task Force)
    . "the overall goal of the IETF is to make the Internet work better."
    . its mission is to produce high quality, and engineering documents that influence 
    the way people design, use, and manage the Internet in such a way as to make the Internet work better.


poll() : (Polling the network)
    Poll the network to retrieve information from network devices that you can use to monitor the behavior of the devices.

select() :

kqueue() : 

epoll() :

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\

Server => describes a role purpose or behavior

-> the thing that makes a porogram => "server":
    it's supplies you with the data you requested 

-> client asks/requests data from server

                        Socket

Socket : is a feature to connect programs (over a network)

    . Used for communication in client_server systems.
    . a Socket is defined as an endpoint for communication.
    . a pair of processes communication over a network employ a pair of sockets 
        one for each process.(when two processes want to communicate there needs to be a connection
        btw them and at each end of the connection each of this processes will employ a socket)
    . a Socket is identified by an IP addr concatenated with a port number(means followed by a port
        number). 
    . the server waits for incoming client requests by listening to a specified port,
        once a request is received, the server accepts a connection from the client socket to complete 
        the connection

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\

                    Requests consist of the following elements:

An HTTP method, usually a verb like GET, POST, or a noun like OPTIONS or HEAD that defines the operation the client wants to perform. Typically, a client wants to fetch a resource (using GET) or post the value of an HTML form (using POST), though more operations may be needed in other cases.
The path of the resource to fetch; the URL of the resource stripped from elements that are obvious from the context, for example without the protocol (http://), the domain (here, developer.mozilla.org), or the TCP port (here, 80).
The version of the HTTP protocol.
Optional headers that convey additional information for the servers.
A body, for some methods like POST, similar to those in responses, which contain the resource sent.

PROXY : is a computer server or program that separates local network from outside
        networks

PROXY SERVER : will cache all pages accessed, that is allowing users next time
        requesting the same page will load faster

API : (Application Programming Interface)
    is a software intermediary that allows two applications
    to talk to each other over the internet
